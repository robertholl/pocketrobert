 11 Some interesting challenges arise when your local host machine is running Windows, but the applicatio    ↪ n you support runs on one or more linux servers.  As a visual, a typical list of applications open     ↪ on any given day include: Outlook, SQL Management Studio, Excel, Notepad++, a network tool, and one    ↪  or more putty sessions.  With all of these applications open during the day, any ability to stream    ↪ line the workflow is more than welcomed.

 13 The linux terminal utility called "screen" allows you to create a virtualized sesson that are indepen    ↪ dent of your connection to server. This can be critical when running a long process that can't be t    ↪ erminated if the remote connection becomes disconnected.  Another great feature is that you can spl    ↪ it a terminal window to have multiple smaller terminals within the larger window.  A good analogy i    ↪ s a house window being the terminal, but then splitting the window into glass areas between the win    ↪ dow muntins.  Once the screen is split it is possible to run a different terminal command in each s    ↪ creen independently.
