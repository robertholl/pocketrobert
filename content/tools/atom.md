# Using Atom for Web site

This will be my first post about using Atom and Hugo site generator to create my first site after many hears of having my head in the sand.


## Helpful Packages

**1. [GitHub](https://atom.io/packages/github)**

  This package allows you to integrate Atom with your Github accout and streamline your workflow directly from Atom development into Github

**2. [Git Plus](https://atom.io/packages/git-plus)**

  Simular to the above package, this allows you to use Git from within Atom and allows you to be able to integrate your remote git respository into your Atom development.  This isn't specific to Github.  The functions are accessible directly from the command pallet using Shift-Ctrl-P.

**3. [Markdown Writer](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-writer)**

  Package that assists with the Markdown syntax through a menu interface.  One can insert images, links, text formatting, headings, and creating tables.  There is also a cheat sheet option to allowing for a side by side view of the syntax for various Markdown options and styles.

**4. [Markdown Preview](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview)**

**5. [Hugo](https://atom.io/packages/atom-hugo)**
