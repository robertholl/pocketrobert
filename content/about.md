My interest in Linux has grown over the years as I have used it increasingly more both professionally and personally. Since graduating from Christopher Newport University in 2005 with a Bachelors of Science in information Science with a concentration in Network Communications and a minor in Computer Science, the last 15 years have had me in the utility industry.

I started working on a Service Desk for a water utility before moving into an Application support role totalling 12 years before changing directions.  I have since been working for a leading AMI vendor supporting our Advanced Meter Information system for water, gas, and electric utilities.
